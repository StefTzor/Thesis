This paper presents the design and implementation of a web-based system used for the archiving of student’s examination papers by the professors in an academic institute, while also having the ability to display said examination paper to a student. As of now, the professor assesses the examination paper and he/she stores it, but when there is the need to display that to the student, it requires a lot of time to search and find it. In the particular thesis, that procedure is automated by implementing an online platform where professors and students alike log into it, thus, improving the situation and time spent on this rigorous procedure. For the implementation of the platform, an appropriate database was designed along with an archiving system, all the functions of the system are employed in a user-friendly web interface. Modern mechanics of web development were used, while also taking into consideration the necessary security mechanisms. The system was successfully implemented in the Department of Informatics of University of Western Macedonia, Greece during the period 2019-2020.
